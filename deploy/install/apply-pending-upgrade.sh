# apply-pending-upgrade.sh — pre-start upgrade hook for opskeeper-edge.
#
# Runs as root via the opskeeper-edge-upgrade.service oneshot, which
# opskeeper-edge.service pulls in (Wants= + After=) so this runs before every
# agent start — including each Restart=always auto-restart. It runs as a
# separate root unit (not the agent's own ExecStartPre) because opskeeper-edge
# runs sandboxed + non-root and cannot write /usr/local; the old
# `ExecStartPre=-+...` relied on the `+` root-exec prefix, which systemd < 231
# (CentOS 7 = 219) silently ignores, so the swap never applied there.
#
# Looks for a staged upgrade bundle the agent dropped at
# /var/lib/opskeeper-edge/.upgrade/incoming/ and atomically swaps every file
# listed in MANIFEST.txt into its declared dest path.
#
# Three modes covered, in priority order:
#
#  1. Rollback     — last upgrade booted but never reported "healthy"
#                    (no healthy_marker matching last_upgrade_ver), so
#                    restore each <dest>.previous over <dest> and clear
#                    last_upgrade_at to prevent a rollback loop.
#  2. Bundle apply — incoming/MANIFEST.txt exists: verify each file's
#                    sha256, then for each one back up to <dest>.previous
#                    and rename a fresh copy into place.
#  3. Single-file  — legacy path (ADR-018 / C11 Phase-B): one binary at
#                    .upgrade/pending swapped over /usr/local/bin/
#                    opskeeper-edge. Kept for back-compat with edges that
#                    haven't been bundle-upgraded yet.
#
# Idempotent + best-effort: if nothing's staged or anything goes wrong
# at validate-time, exit 0 so systemd starts whatever binary is on disk.
# We never block the unit on upgrade-side mistakes.

# plugin (promtail) can read /var/log/* (root:adm 640) and the journal.
# Bundle upgrades (ADR-024) DON'T re-run install-edge.sh, so a box that was
# installed before that grant — or one whose groups got dropped — would
# silently ship empty logs forever. Re-assert membership here: this hook
# runs as root on every start (via the opskeeper-edge-upgrade.service oneshot,
# ordered Before=opskeeper-edge.service), and systemd resolves supplementary
# groups when it forks the agent's ExecStart, so a group added now takes
# effect for the agent that starts moments later. Idempotent
# (usermod -aG is a no-op if already a member).
