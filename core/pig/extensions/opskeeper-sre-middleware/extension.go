// Package opskeepermiddleware is the live-middleware read toolset: the
// tools a node's agent offers for questions about the databases, caches,
// clusters and brokers the control plane is connected to.
//
// Every tool here does the same thing. It declares a name, a description
// and a schema, and when the model calls it, it carries the call across a
// unix socket to the OpsKeeper host on this node and returns what the host
// said. The implementations — listing PostgreSQL sessions, censusing Redis
// keys, reading a Kubernetes pod list — are not here. They are in the
// control plane, where the DSNs and the credentials are configured, where
// every tool already has a permission class, and where the answer is
// auditable.
//
// That split is the whole design and not a shortcut:
//
//   - The tools could not be implemented here. A subprocess on a node has
//     no path to the manager's PostgreSQL DSN, its Redis endpoint, its
//     kubeconfig or its broker credentials. A node that held them would be
//     a node that could be talked into using them, and the reach would be
//     the node's rather than the operator's.
//   - The agent process runs with the node's privileges. Routing means the
//     agent holds no capability the host did not hand it, and no credential
//     it was not configured with.
//   - The host re-checks the allow-list before it dispatches. The gate
//     already refused the call on the way in, but the gate is reached
//     through an extension in this process — a package that replaced it
//     would silence that check. This one cannot.
//
// Every tool in this package is classified L0 or L1 by the adapter that
// implements it, and the package ships only those. The way this package
// could become dangerous is not a malicious edit to the manifest — it is a
// routine change to an adapter that nobody thinks to re-check — so the
// class is asserted where it is decided, not here.
//
// **Where the check actually lives**, because this paragraph used to get it
// wrong in a way that sends the next reader looking in the wrong tree: the
// generated tools.go carries no class field, and the test that enforces
// this is not in this package. It is
// core/manager/middleware/toolset:
//
//   - TestTheMiddlewareToolsetIsReadOnly asserts, per tool and against the
//     adapters' own registration, that no write-classified tool reached the
//     read toolset — and that the registry is non-empty and does contain
//     writes, so it cannot pass for the wrong reason;
//   - TestToolsetMatchesTheAdapters compares this package's file with what
//     the generator produces, byte for byte, so a reclassification shows up
//     as a failing diff rather than as a line nobody notices in a 52-entry
//     diff.
//
// Two of those live in a different module from this one, so a reader who
// greps only the extension packages concludes there is no guard. There is.
//
// The writes those adapters also offer (pg.kill_session, k8s.drain,
// redis.flushdb) deliberately do not appear here at any version. They are
// reachable through the control plane's approval path, where a human sees
// the blast radius before anything runs, and offering them on the node's
// upcall channel would be a second door into the same room with no queue
// behind it.
//
// The manifest's tool list is therefore the review surface, and it is
// generated from the same registration this file is: an adapter that gains
// a read tool shows up as a diff somebody has to accept.

// Extension builds the toolset.
//
// It reads only the broker socket path from the environment, and it does
// so at load rather than per call: a tool definition has to exist before
// the model can call it, so there is no "report it when it is used" option
// for a missing socket. The tools are registered regardless. An agent with
// no broker is an agent that can hold a conversation and cannot reach the
// control plane, which is the correct failure — and each call says exactly
// why, rather than the tool silently not existing.
//
// Registration cannot fail per tool, so a schema this package ships that
// the agent cannot parse would be a load-time panic in PiG. That is
// deliberate: the schemas in tools.go are generated from the live registry
// and copied in by scripts/sync-pig-ops.sh, so a broken one is an
// author-time mistake, and an author-time mistake should stop the build
// rather than quietly removing `query_promql` from production.
