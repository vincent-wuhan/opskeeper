// kernelpath.go runs one turn on the agent kernel. It is the only loop the
// runtime has: the retired graph path was removed rather than kept as a
// second branch.
//
// The two paths share everything up to the loop: ownership, mention rendering,
// user-message persistence, history loading, skill and credential resolution,
// persona and tool-bag filtering, prompt composition, and the per-turn tool
// context. What differs is only how the loop is driven and how the frames come
// back — which is the point of the kernel seam, and why this file must not
// re-derive any of the policy above it. A second derivation is where a
// viewer's session quietly regains a mutating tool.

// kernelTurn is the resolved state one kernel turn runs with. It is a struct
// rather than a parameter list because every field is already-decided policy:
// a positional call would let a caller pass the unresolved bag and a reader
// would not see it.
type kernelTurn struct {
	// Sess is the owning session. Its ID is the transcript key.
	Sess *aiopsmodel.Session
	// History is the persisted transcript, oldest first, including the user
	// row this turn just appended. buildKernelHistory trims that row.
	History []*aiopsmodel.Message
	// Tools is the persona-, role- and write-gate-filtered bag, already
	// wrapped in the per-run governance decorator.
	Tools []basetool.BaseTool
	// SystemPrompt is the fully composed base prompt, without the language
	// directive (which is appended here, as the retired path did).
	SystemPrompt string
	// UserText is the live turn with @-mentions already inlined. The persisted
	// user row carries the same text, and the history trim is what stops the
	// model from seeing it twice.

	// DynamicHints and AgentReminder are the per-turn reminder inputs.

//
// Both kernels go through here so a tool cannot behave differently depending
// on which loop called it:
//
//   - the filtered bag, so ToolSearch only offers what this persona may see;
//   - the UI locale, so AgentTool forwards it into a sub-agent's request (a
//     coordinator handling an English question otherwise hands off to a
//     specialist that answers in zh — regression 2026-06-02);
//   - the resolved provider+model, so sub-agents do not fall through to the
//     routing default and fail with `provider "openai" not configured`;
//   - the session id, so cloud_bash resolves a per-session workspace;
//   - the artifact source, so the operations UI can tell assistant pages from
//     workflow pages;
//   - the admin write gate, so a single setting read drives both tool exposure
//     and host-command authority.
