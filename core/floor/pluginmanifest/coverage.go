// What a plugin package can actually do, for the purposes of regression
// scoring.
//
// The harness scores an incident case against the tools the agent called.
// A case's expectation is written as "<domain>.<method>" — pg.lock_waits,
// host.host_load — naming the *capability*, not the package that offers it.
// This file is the join between the two vocabularies: given a package's
// manifest, which capabilities does it add to a node.
//
// It exists because the join is not mechanical. A package's tools are
// named the way the model calls them (host_probe_tcp, query_promql), while
// a case names the middleware method behind them (host.host_probe_tcp? no —
// host.* is the host skill family), and the two vocabularies were written
// by different people at different times. Guessing the mapping would make
// the coverage report a description of the guess rather than of the
// packages, so the mapping is declared here, once, and drift between it
// and the shipped packages is a test failure rather than a wrong number.

// Capability tags a package's tools are grouped under.
//
// They are the resource prefixes the harness case files already use —
// "host", "pg", "k8s" — so a case's root_cause_lines can be matched
// against a package without a second translation table.

//   - host — the host adapter executes as root on the machine OpsKeeper

//     family is already served by the read-only package's own probes and by
//     get_host_load, so its reads are a second route to an answer the fleet
//     already has, and its writes belong to the approval path.
//   - git — the git adapter's repository reads duplicate the observability
//     package's source family. Its one non-duplicate, the git-artifact
//     linker, is packaged and is its own family (see CapGitArtifact), which
//     is why "git" here does not mean "the git adapter is unpackaged".
//
// core/manager/middleware/toolset records the same exclusions next to the code
// that enforces them, and a test in cmd/opskeeper-eval — the only package
// that may import both sides — fails if the two lists stop agreeing.
//
// The vocabulary is read from the adapter implementations
// (core/manager/middleware/adapter/<pkg>/<pkg>.go registers "<pkg>.method" tool
// names), not from the resource directory a case happens to sit in. The two
// differ: the k8s cases name k8s.* tools, but the mq cases name kafka.*
// and rabbitmq.* — the directory is the topic, the prefix is the system —
// so a list built from directory names would fail to place every Kafka and
// RabbitMQ expectation and report them as packages that were never supposed
// to exist.
