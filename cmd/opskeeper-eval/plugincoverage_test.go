// The tests in this file are about one property: the coverage command has to
// be able to fail.
//
// The report it prints has said "0/20 cases fully covered" for as long as it
// has existed, and it will keep saying it, because every golden case names a
// remediation and no node package ships a write — the approval queue that
// makes a write safe lives on the control plane, and a node's upcall channel
// has no queue behind it. That number is a decision, not a measurement, and
// it has the property that no change to the fleet can move it.
//
// So the diagnosis half was split out and made into the axis a build can
// fail on. What these tests pin is that the split is real and that the flag
// distinguishes the two kinds of gap: a recorded decision, which is the
// backlog, and an unrecorded one, which is a regression. A flag that fired
// on both would be red from the day it was written, and a permanently red
// gate is the reason the joint verdict went unread for months.

// writePackage lays down a package with exactly the tools the test needs.
//
// The manifest is written by hand rather than copied from plugins/pig-ops
// because a test that copies a shipped package cannot vary the fleet: every
// case below needs a package that is one tool different from the last, and
// the real packages are fifty-three tools long.
