// The node's plugin store: what a package has to survive to become
// something this node's agent can call.
//
// The order of the checks below is the whole design, and it is not
// negotiable. A package arrives as bytes from a URL, and everything the
// bytes say about themselves is a claim by the bytes. So:
//
//	1. the transport digest is checked before the archive is opened, so a
//	   corrupt or substituted body never reaches the extractor at all;
//	2. the bytes are extracted into a staging directory that is not the
//	   package directory, so nothing a package contains is reachable from
//	   the active set until the last step;
//	3. the review runs in the node's own fixed order — signature, then
//	   manifest, then this node's policy — so a package that lies about
//	   its capabilities is refused by the signature step rather than by a
//	   later check that would have believed it;
//	4. the manifest's own name and version must agree with what the
//	   control plane asked for, so a mirror that serves two different
//	   bodies for one version cannot install under either name;
//	5. only then is the staging directory moved into place and the agent's
//	   package list rewritten atomically.
//
// Any failure at any step leaves the previous package set exactly as it
// was. That is not tidiness: a node that has lost a tool it had an hour
// ago produces a model that confidently reports a capability it does not
// have, and nothing in the transcript distinguishes that from a bug.

// maxPluginBundleBytes caps a plugin tarball.
//
// A plugin is Go sources, Markdown and manifests — the largest shipped
// package is a few hundred kilobytes. A megabyte is generous by two

// chosen by whoever controls the URL, read by a process on a node that
// has a disk rather than a memory budget.

	// whose agent has quietly lost the read-only package it has been
