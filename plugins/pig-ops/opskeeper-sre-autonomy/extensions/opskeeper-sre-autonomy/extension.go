// Package opskeepersreautonomy is the self-heal toolset: the one tool the
// agent offers for an action a node may take with nobody there to approve
// it, declared and routed but never implemented here.
//
// Every tool in this package declares a name, a description and a schema,
// and when the model calls it, the call is carried across a unix socket to
// the OpsKeeper host on this node. The implementation — the arbiter, the
// signed manifest, the sandbox, the audit spool — is in the host, where it
// already existed, already carries permission classes, and is already
// wrapped in the review that produced the signature.
//
// What makes this package different from the mutating one is *who answers*.
//
// The mutating toolset is answered by the control plane, always, because
// the reviewer that must see a proposal lives on the other side of the
// tunnel. This one is answered by the node — but only while the control
// plane is unreachable, and only for an argument vector a person read and
// signed when the package was admitted. So:
//
//   - The agent process still runs with the node's privileges and gains
//     none. The argv is not in this package, not in this process, and not
//     reachable from anything the model can write. The model names an
//     action; the host resolves that name against the manifest and runs
//     the manifest's own argv.
//   - The tool is registered unconditionally, and the host refuses the
//     call on a node that declared no autonomy. An agent that can discuss
//     self-healing and cannot perform it is the correct failure, and the
//     refusal says exactly that rather than the tool silently not
//     existing.
//   - The host re-checks everything on arrival: that this package
//     declared the tool, that the node's role may run it, that the arbiter
//     is the authority, and — while the control plane is away — that the
//     action was declared, its trigger actually holds, the argv matches
//     byte for byte, the reach is inside the node's ceiling, the window
//     has not expired, and the key has not been spent.
//
// The last list is the reason this is a tool rather than a shell. Seven
// checks a model cannot talk its way past, in front of a command the model
// never gets to write.

//
// Registration cannot fail per tool, so a schema this package ships that
// the agent cannot parse would be a load-time panic in PiG. That is
// deliberate: these schemas are literals in this file, so a broken one is
// an author-time mistake, and an author-time mistake should stop the build
// rather than quietly removing a self-heal capability from production.
